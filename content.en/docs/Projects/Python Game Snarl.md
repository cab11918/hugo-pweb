*This is a 2D multiplayer online game developed using Python, with PyGame as the frontend framework. The game incorporates TCP sockets for communication between the client and server for the online functionality. The game architecture utilizes multiple threads to handle communication with the server separately from the GUI user interface. In the game, players are tasked with finding keys in different levels to progress to the next level. Meanwhile, AI-controlled monsters employ breadth-first search algorithms to track down the players and attempt to eliminate them.*
